variable scope 
scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid

 local variables (inside the braces and can only accessed from there).

 global variables (outside the function and can  accessed from anywhere).

data type 
type of data a variable can hold 
>built-in (int, float,char, double,bool(true,flase)) 
>user defined (struct,union,enum) 
>derived (array, function,pointer)

input output is known as streams 
input streams
to take in put syntax(cin>>(extration operator))  
output streams  
to display in put syntax(cout<<(insertion operator))

header files 
1) system 
2) uder-defiened

operators in c++
Arithmetic Operators
(+,-,*,/,%,++,--)
Assignment Operators(=)
Comparison Operators(<=,>=,==,!=,<,>)
Logical Operators(&&,||,!)

To access the value of the global variable "c," we use scope resolution operator "::" with the  variable.

A decimal no. eg: 3.14 is by default a double , to specify it as float or long double a sufix is added to it 
eg
1> for float "f"
2> for long double "l" .

Refernce variables 
it is known as anothere name for a variable

typcasting 
converting one data type onto othere

constants 
they are unchangeable variables , once declared cannot change throught out the programme 
eg: const float pie = 3.14 ;

manipulator is used in the formatting of output
"endl" is used for the next line.
"setw" is used to specify the width of the output.
